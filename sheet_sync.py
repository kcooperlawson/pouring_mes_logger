"""Where an export goes, and whether the address will actually take it.

The plant's Google Sheet used to be one line in .env: a single webhook, set
once by whoever installed the application, changeable only by editing a file
on the server. That has three problems and this plant hit all of them. Nobody
but the installer can point it anywhere. There is exactly one destination, so
a second manager who wants their own sheet cannot have one. And when the line
is missing or the deployment behind it has been revoked, the page says
"webhook missing" and there is nothing anybody can do about it from inside the
application - which is where they are standing when they find out.

So a destination is a row somebody can add, and the awkward part is told
plainly rather than assumed away: **a Google Sheet link is not an address that
can receive anything.** A spreadsheet URL is a document. To send rows to it,
that sheet needs a small Apps Script published as a web app, and the address
of THAT is what goes in the box. Everybody pastes the spreadsheet link first -
it is the link they have - so classify_url exists to notice, say so in one
sentence, and hand over the script and the four steps rather than reporting a
validation failure and leaving them to work out why.

Pure functions and one constant. No Streamlit, no database, no requests: what
is worth testing here is the reasoning about addresses and date ranges, and
none of that needs a network or a browser to be wrong.
