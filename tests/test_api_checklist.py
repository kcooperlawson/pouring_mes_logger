"""The daily pre-shift gate, ported from pages/operator_form/checklist.py's
render_checklist_gate() onto api/routers/checklist.py. Checks the same
rules the Streamlit version enforced (checklist requires today's
cleanliness photo first; both manual boxes required) plus the one
deliberate hardening: cleanliness-done-today is a real server-side query
now (cleanliness_audits), not a browser cookie, so /submit can trust it
instead of trusting whatever the client last rendered.
