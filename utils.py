# set_cookie/flash/draw_flashes/do_logout/check_authentication used to live
# here - the Streamlit UI's own cookie-write timing fix, toast-that-survives-
# a-rerun banner, sign-out sequencing, and session-restore. All five existed
# only because Streamlit reruns the whole page script on every interaction;
# the FastAPI app doesn't have that problem (api/deps.py's get_current_user
# and api/routers/auth.py's login/logout are the real, current versions of
# what these did), and retired along with Home.py/pages/ui_shell.py when the
# Streamlit UI was.
