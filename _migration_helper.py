"""
_migration_helper.py - Backs and restores the Formlabs MES database when
moving the project to a different PC.

Deliberately reuses utils.py's create_database_backup() / restore_database_backup()
instead of re-implementing pg_dump/psql argument handling here — those
functions already derive host/user/port/dbname/password from this
machine's own .env (DB_URL), which is exactly the credential source that
needs to be correct on whichever PC this script is run on.

Called by Move_To_New_PC.bat (on the OLD pc) and Setup_On_New_PC.bat
(on the NEW pc). Not meant to be run by hand, but it's safe to:
    python _migration_helper.py backup
    python _migration_helper.py ensure_db
    python _migration_helper.py restore <filename_in_backups_folder>
    python _migration_helper.py db_host
    python _migration_helper.py check_dump_compat <filename_in_backups_folder>
    python _migration_helper.py verify_restore <filename_in_backups_folder>
