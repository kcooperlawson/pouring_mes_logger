def init_db():
    """Brings the database schema up to date via Alembic.

    Replaces the old pattern of Base.metadata.create_all() plus a
    hand-maintained, ever-growing list of raw ALTER TABLE strings wrapped in
    a silent try/except (which couldn't tell "column already exists" from a
    real failure). Schema changes now live as versioned files in
    migrations/versions/ — see migrations/versions/0001_baseline_schema.py
    for the full history up to the point Alembic was introduced.

    Handles the one-time transition automatically, so this still self-heals
    on every boot the way the old init_db() did:
      - Brand-new, empty database: runs every migration from scratch.
      - Existing database that already has the app's tables (built by the
        pre-Alembic init_db()) but was never stamped with a migration
        version: gets stamped at the baseline instead of re-running
        CREATE TABLE against tables that already exist. This assumes the
        existing schema is fully caught up with the old ALTER TABLE list —
        true for any database this app has been booted against, since that
        list ran on every prior boot.
      - Already stamped (normal case after the first boot on this version):
        just applies any migrations added since.

    Every one of those three paths ends at head. That was not true until it
    was tested: stamping used to be an `else` branch, so a pre-Alembic
    database got marked as being at the baseline and then ran the rest of that
    boot against a schema seven revisions behind the models. It died on the
    first settings query with "column plant_settings.shift_count does not
    exist" - and the way to reach it is to restore an older backup onto a new
    machine and start the app, which is exactly what somebody setting up a
    second PC does. Stamping says where the database already is; it is not a
    substitute for bringing it up to date.

    The stamp is written as a plain INSERT rather than through
    `command.stamp`, because Alembic's environment is not re-entrant within
    one process (see below) and this path has to run a real upgrade
    immediately afterwards.

    Idempotent within a process: unlike the old raw-SQL version, Alembic's
    command.upgrade()/command.stamp() aren't designed to be re-entered
    multiple times in one running process (its internal EnvironmentContext
    teardown breaks the second time around — surfaces as a stray
    `KeyError: 'script'`). Streamlit re-executes Home.py's script on every
    rerun, and this function is called both from crud.py's own module-level
    bootstrap and explicitly from Home.py, so without this guard the real
    Alembic call could fire many times over a single session. The guard
    below makes every call after the first a no-op.

    hourly log and the lot check makes them read it off the container. So the
    current batch is the newest lot logged at this pump, and everything logged
    since that lot started is what has been drawn from the tank.

    This used to be read off the work order instead. The run supplied the lot
    to scope by and the container format to size the units with, and neither
    has a substitute when a plant does not dispatch runs: with no lot the tank
    summed every log ever recorded for that resin and pump, so it drained to
    empty and stayed there, and with no format every unit was assumed to be a
    1 L cartridge, so a tank drawn down in 5 L jugs emptied five times too
    slowly. Deriving it from the lot costs a manager nothing and reads the same
    in either mode - a plant that does dispatch runs puts the same lot on the
    run and on the log, so the answer does not change.

    A resin coming BACK onto a pump it already held once is the one case the
    lot walk cannot see on its own: with nothing new logged yet under it,
    "the newest lot anywhere in this resin/pump's history" is still whatever
    the tank last held months ago, and the walk drags that entire old
    occupancy's draw-down along with it. Every path that starts a fresh
    occupancy (record_changeover, mark_reactor_filled) already opens a
    ReactorBatch the moment it happens, so when one is open for the vessel
    this resolves to, its filled_at is used as a hard floor on the log query
    - a resin's own history before its current fill started is never even
    read. A vessel with no open batch (never linked through those paths, or
    set up through the raw manage-fleet edit) falls back to the old
    unbounded read, unchanged.

    ProductionLog row is written either way, this only reports whether a
    specific run's counter moved, so the caller can tell the operator when
    it didn't (previously this failed completely silently, which is why a
    trailing space or case difference in a lot number could make a run's
    "current_units" quietly stop climbing with no indication why).

    Matching is case-/whitespace-insensitive and treats a blank lot number
    on either side as a wildcard, mirroring
    calculate_logged_units_for_resin()'s tolerance — an exact, case-
    sensitive match was too strict given pump/resin/cartridge values both
    ultimately come from the same dropdowns but lot numbers are free-typed
    by both the manager (creating the run) and the operator (logging
    against it).

    `verification` is the cartridge lot check the operator completed for
    this log, as assembled by the pouring form (see add_lot_verification
    for the shape and the meaning of each result). It is optional so that
    every existing caller - the Admin Panel, reconciliation, and the
    Device Gateway writer - keeps working untouched.

    `litres_poured` is a measured volume, for the pours that are an amount
    rather than a count of containers - so many litres decanted into a drum.
    It is None on an ordinary cartridge log, which is the common case, and
    when it is set it is what every total reads instead of multiplying the
    container count by the format size. `pour_note` is what it went into, in
    the operator's words, and nothing parses it. Both are optional so that
    every existing caller - the Admin Panel, reconciliation, and the Device
    Gateway writer - keeps working untouched.

    `off_tank` says this resin did not come out of the vessel on that station.
    It is production either way and counts wherever production is counted; the
    level arithmetic is the only reader that cares, and it skips these rows so
    that resin decanted out of a drum is not subtracted from a tank it left
    days ago. False by default, which is what every pour was until somebody
    filled bottles off a drum on the floor.

    `weight` is the fill-weight reading for this log, as returned by
    fill_weight.judge(), or None when the operator did not take one - which
    is the common case and is fine. Unlike the lot check it is purely a
    measurement: nothing about it can prevent the log being written. Its
    status was judged against the resin's window at the moment of capture
    and is stored as given, so editing a spec later cannot retrospectively
    re-judge a reading somebody already took.
