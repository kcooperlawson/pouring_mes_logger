"""Checks for a newer signed update package than this PC is running, and
applies one - the network-reachable half of the same trusted pipeline
setup/apply_update.py already runs off a USB stick.

Two places it can look, in this order:

  * MES_UPDATE_URL in .env - any address serving a small latest.json, which
    is what setup/update_server.py does from a PC you run yourself. Nothing
    about it is GitHub-shaped: a folder on a web server, a NAS, or a home PC
    with one port open all work the same way.
  * GitHub Releases otherwise (see dev/update_publish.py for what puts one
    there). A private repo needs a read-only token on this PC.

Where it came from doesn't decide whether it's trusted: the package is signed
and every file checksummed, and setup/apply_update.py refuses one that isn't
signed by the real key whichever route it arrived by. That is why serving
updates over plain HTTP from a home PC is not the hole it sounds like - the
worst a tampered copy achieves is a refused update.

Deliberately thin: every safety property (checksum, signature, backup,
rollback-on-failure) already lives in setup/apply_update.py and
setup/update_signing.py, and this module reuses that code rather than
duplicating any of it. Its only two jobs are "is there something newer" and
"fetch it to updates\\ so apply_update.py can take it from there exactly
like it always has" - a plant PC on the auto-update path and one worked
from a USB stick end up running the identical apply().
