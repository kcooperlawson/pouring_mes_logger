"""Login, logout, and session-restore - the entire auth surface.

Reuses crud.py's session model exactly as Streamlit's "remember this
device" cookie already does (crud.create_session/get_user_by_session_token
/delete_session, backed by the same user_sessions table) - the only
behavior change is that a session row is now created on every login, not
only when "remember" is ticked. A React SPA has no per-tab server memory
the way st.session_state gave a running Streamlit script, so a page reload
has nothing to restore identity from except the cookie; "remember" only
decides whether that cookie survives closing the browser.
