"""The FastAPI backend for the React frontend replacing this project's
Streamlit pages one at a time, starting with the Operator Form (see the
migration plan). Reuses crud.py/models.py/db_core.py exactly as the
Streamlit pages do - import crud/models/db_core directly here, never
database.py, which is a Streamlit-only facade (st.cache_data, a can() that
reads st.session_state) around the same functions.

Route handlers in this package are plain `def`, not `async def`: crud.py's
ScopedSession is thread-local, and Starlette runs sync routes in its own
thread pool, which is the model this DB layer already assumes (the same way
Streamlit runs each script on a worker thread). An async route would run
psycopg2's blocking calls on the single event-loop thread instead.
